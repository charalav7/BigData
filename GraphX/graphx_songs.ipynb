    "# Lab 4 - GraphX\n",
    "In this lab we use GraphX to cluster music songs according to the tags attached to each song. The datasets that we are working is available under the folder `data`, and also can be downloaded from [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shuochen/lme/data_page.html). The datasets consist of the following files:\n",
    "* `song_hash.txt`: this file maps a song ID to its title and artist.\n",
    "  + Each line corresponds to one song, and has the format called `Integer_ID\\tTitle\\tArtist\\n`.\n",
    "* `tag_hash.txt`: this one maps a tag ID to its name.\n",
    "  + Each line corresponds to one song, and has the format called `Integer_ID, Name\\n`.\n",
    "* `tags.txt`: this file includes the social tags by using the integer ID to represent songs.\n",
    "  + The tag data file has the same number of lines as the total number of songs. Each line consists of the IDs of the tags for a song, represented by integers, and separated by space. If a song does not have a tag, its line is just a #. Note that for the tag file, there is no space at the end of each line.\n",

    "### Load the data into a Spark graph property\n",
